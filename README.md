# Chemical-Reaction-Simulator
The user inserts a chemical reaction and the program outputs n(t), C(t) (if appropriate) and U(t) plots by simulating the reaction.

The project started off as a [Python Script](<https://github.com/konstantinosk31/Chemical-Reaction-Simulator/blob/main/reactions.py>) and, later, turned into a [Website](<https://konstantinosk31.github.io/Chemical-Reaction-Simulator/>) made for educational purposes.

For now, the simulator assumes all reactions are simple.
